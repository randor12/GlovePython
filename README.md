# GlovePython

This is an implementation of Stanford's Word Embedding Tool, [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/). 

For GloVe, it is a log-bilinear model with a weighted least-squares objective. This allows for the model to observe the ratio of word-word co-occurence probabilities for target words. 

This is an extension of the Word2Vec package created by Google.
